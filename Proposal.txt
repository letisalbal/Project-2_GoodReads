Project: GoodRead Book Analysis

Description:

We will be using the following two data sets to analyze how many of the books listed were turned into movies.

1. https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k#books.csv
2. https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

We will be cleaning the Goodbooks-10K data to extract the following columns to use for our analysis:

1. Book_ID
2. Title
3. Authors

From the TMDB-Movie we will extract Title only to do our analysis.
